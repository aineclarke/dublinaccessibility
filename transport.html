        <p>Dublin Transport Services tend to be quite accomodating of wheelchair users, although there are some limitations, <br> so we hope to provide you with the best possible information on getting from one place to antother aswell as some other alterntives if needed.<br>
        </p>
            <h2>Bus</h2>
      <p>The main provider of bus services in Dublin, the publicly-owned Dublin Bus, uses low-floor, wheelchair-accessible buses on ALL of its routes. <br> 
            Additionally, Dublin Bus runs a travel assistance scheme to help those with a mobility impairment to travel around Dublin using either bus, train or tram. An assistant can accompany you the first few times you travel, and give you advice on planning a journey. <br> 
            The Travel Assistance Scheme is free and is for people aged 18 or over. You can use it Monday to Friday between 08:00hrs and 18:00hrs.<br>
          <br>
           Bus Eireann is Ireland’s main provider of long-distance coach services, many of which operate in the Greater Dublin area. <br> Although many of its services are fully wheelchair accessible, not all are.<br>
        You can find the full list of wheelchair friendly routes from<a href="https://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=753#city">this link.</a></p>
        
        <h2>Trains</h2>
        <p>Trains in Dublin are wheelchair accessible, as are most of the stations. Staff can usually assist with the boarding of trains via the provision of wheelchair ramps too.<br>
            However, depending on station staffing levels, help is not always at hand. Irish Rail therefore ask those with a mobility impairment to contact them in advance of travel to ensure that full support with your journey is provided. <br>You can do so by emailing<a href="mailto: access@irirshrail.ie">access@irishrail.ie</a></p>
        
        <h2>Luas</h2>
        
        <p>Dublin’s tram system, ‘Luas,’ has been designed to be fully accessible and it is the easiest mode of transport in Dublin to use if you have a mobility impairment. </p>
        
        <h2>Taxi</h2>
        
        <p>Taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis are public hire vehicles. <br>Their licence and licensing requirements allow them to stand for hire at a rank (taxi ranks at airports, train and bus stations) and they can also be hailed on the street.<br>
            The vehicle is equipped with a taximeter to ensure the maximum fare charged is within regulations. <br>
        <br>
        It is also possible to book private owned wheelchair accessible taxis from  great Dublin owned company called "dublin Wheelchair Taxis". <br> You can find there website from the following<a href="https://www.dublinwheelchairtaxis.com/">link.</a></p>
        
        <h2>"Planning a Journey"</h2>
        <p>Before you start your journey, you can use<a href="https://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/">Transport for Ireland’s online journey planner</a>to plan your journey. <br> The journey planner will give you information about bus and rail routes all over Ireland. <br>It will also tell you if a service is wheelchair accessible.<br> If you can’t travel alone, you may be able to get a free travel pass for your travel companion. </p>
